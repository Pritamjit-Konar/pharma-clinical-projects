## 🎯 Project Objective  

This mock project is designed to demonstrate my practical understanding of entry-level **Clinical Data Management (CDM)** activities performed in a CRO environment, aligned to **Data Process Associate** responsibilities.  

The project simulates how clinical data is transcribed from **CRFs/eCRFs into an EDC-style dataset**, verified through **quality checks**, supported with **basic database testing documentation**, and maintained with an **inspection-ready documentation mindset** aligned with **ICH-GCP principles** for reliable trial data.  

All data used is **fictional** and created strictly for **learning and portfolio demonstration purposes**.

## 📌 Scope of This Project  

This project covers:  

- CRF to database data entry simulation (data transcription + format checks)  
- Data verification and QC checks to support clean, consistent, and traceable clinical trial data  
- Edit-check / discrepancy handling simulation (identifying issues and documenting corrections)  
- Database testing support (UAT-style test cases + expected vs actual results documentation)  
- User Access Management documentation for an EDC system (access request log + role tracking concept)  
- Medical coding practice (basic coding workflow awareness; readiness to learn MedDRA/WHO Drug as required)

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated  

- Clinical data processing mindset: accuracy, consistency, and traceability from CRF/eCRF to database  
- Quality control: completeness checks, logic checks, and discrepancy identification before finalization  
- Documentation discipline: controlled templates, versioning, and audit-ready records  
- Basic ICH-GCP understanding related to data reliability and proper data handling in clinical trials  
- Collaboration readiness: structured handoffs/updates that support teamwork and timely delivery
